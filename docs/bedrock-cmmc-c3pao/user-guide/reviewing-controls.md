# Reviewing Controls

Detailed guidance on assessing CMMC practices and controls.

## Control Review Interface

When reviewing a control, you'll see:

- **Control ID and Title** - The CMMC practice identifier
- **Control Description** - Official CMMC requirement text
- **Customer Response** - Organization's implementation statement
- **Linked Evidence** - All evidence attached to this control
- **Assessment History** - Previous review status (if any)

## Assessment Determinations

For each control, select one of the following:

### Met

The control is fully implemented and adequately evidenced:
- Implementation aligns with CMMC requirements
- Evidence supports the implementation statement
- No significant gaps identified

### Not Met

The control has deficiencies:
- Implementation is missing or incomplete
- Evidence is insufficient or contradictory
- Significant gaps exist in coverage

### Not Applicable

The control doesn't apply to the assessment scope:
- Technology or process isn't used
- Scope exclusion is justified
- Document the justification

## Assessment Criteria

When evaluating controls, consider:

### Implementation Quality

- Is the control fully implemented across all in-scope systems?
- Are there any gaps in coverage?
- Is the implementation sustainable?

### Evidence Sufficiency

- Does evidence directly support the implementation claim?
- Is evidence current and relevant?
- Are multiple forms of evidence provided where appropriate?

### Documentation

- Are policies and procedures documented?
- Is documentation current and approved?
- Do procedures match actual practice?

## Recording Your Assessment

### Status Selection

1. Select the appropriate status (Met/Not Met/N/A)
2. The interface will prompt for required information

### Notes and Observations

Document your assessment rationale:
- Key evidence reviewed
- Observations made
- Factors influencing your determination

### Findings (for Not Met)

When marking a control as Not Met, document:
- Specific deficiency identified
- Impact of the gap
- Recommendation for remediation

## Bulk Actions

For efficiency, you can:

- Review multiple controls in sequence
- Apply the same status to related controls (with justification)
- Filter controls by status or domain

## Evidence Requests

If additional evidence is needed:

1. Click **Request Evidence**
2. Describe what's needed and why
3. Set a response deadline
4. The organization receives notification

The control remains in pending status until evidence is provided.

## Best Practices

- **Be thorough** - Review all linked evidence before determining status
- **Document rationale** - Clear notes support your determination
- **Be consistent** - Apply the same standards across all controls
- **Stay objective** - Base determinations on evidence, not assumptions
