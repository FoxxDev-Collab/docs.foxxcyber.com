### Key Metrics

The top of the dashboard displays four metric cards:

| **New Requests** | Assessment requests awaiting your response |
| **In Progress** | Active assessments currently underway |
| **Total Active** | All engagements not yet completed |
| **Completed** | Finished assessments |

### New Request Alert

When you have pending requests, a prominent alert banner appears with a direct link to review them.
