## Control Review Process

For each CMMC practice:

### 1. Review Implementation Statement

Read the organization's description of how they implement the control.

### 2. Examine Evidence

Review all evidence linked to the control:
- Documents and policies
- Screenshots and configurations
- Audit logs and reports
- Training records

### 3. Assess Compliance

Determine if the control is:
- **Met** - Fully implemented and evidenced
- **Not Met** - Missing or inadequate implementation
- **Not Applicable** - Control doesn't apply to scope

### 4. Document Findings

Record your assessment notes, observations, and any findings.

## Assessment Progress Tracking

Monitor progress across all controls:

| Domain | Total | Reviewed | Met | Not Met | N/A |
|--------|-------|----------|-----|---------|-----|
| AC | 22 | 18 | 15 | 2 | 1 |
