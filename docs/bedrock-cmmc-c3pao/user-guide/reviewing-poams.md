# Reviewing POA&Ms

Guidance on evaluating Plans of Action and Milestones.

## Understanding POA&Ms

POA&Ms document known security gaps and remediation plans. During assessment, you'll review:

- Existing POA&Ms from prior assessments
- New POA&Ms created for identified findings
- Remediation progress and timelines

## Accessing POA&Ms

Navigate to the **POA&M** section within an engagement to view all remediation items.

## POA&M Structure

Each POA&M contains:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Finding | Description of the security gap |
| Control | CMMC practice affected |
| Risk Level | Severity of the finding |
| Remediation Plan | Steps to address the gap |
| Milestones | Key dates and checkpoints |
| Status | Current remediation progress |
| Owner | Person responsible for remediation |

## Evaluation Criteria

When reviewing POA&Ms, assess:

### Finding Accuracy

- Is the gap clearly described?
- Is the affected control correctly identified?
- Is the risk level appropriate?

### Remediation Plan Quality

- Is the plan realistic and achievable?
- Are steps specific and actionable?
- Will completion actually close the gap?

### Timeline Reasonableness

- Are milestones realistic?
- Is the completion date achievable?
- Are interim checkpoints defined?

### Progress Evidence

- Is progress being made?
- Are milestones being met?
- Is evidence of remediation available?

## POA&M Status Review

Review the status of each POA&M:

| Status | Assessor Action |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Open** | Evaluate plan and timeline |
| **In Progress** | Verify progress, review evidence |
| **Completed** | Validate remediation, review close-out evidence |
| **Delayed** | Assess revised timeline, understand blockers |

## Assessment Considerations

### For Existing POA&Ms

- Has progress been made since creation?
- Are timelines being met?
- Is the organization actively working remediation?

### For New Findings

- Ensure POA&Ms are created for all findings
- Verify remediation plans are adequate
- Confirm reasonable timelines

### Risk-Based Approach

Consider the overall risk posture:

- Number of open POA&Ms
- Severity distribution
- Time items have been open
- Remediation velocity

## POA&M Acceptability

For conditional certification, POA&Ms must:

- Address non-critical findings only
- Have reasonable remediation timelines
- Include specific, achievable milestones
- Demonstrate organizational commitment

## Recording POA&M Assessment

Document your evaluation:

1. Review each POA&M for adequacy
2. Note any concerns about plans or timelines
3. Flag POA&Ms that may impact certification
4. Include POA&M status in final assessment

## Best Practices

- **Be realistic** - Understand that not all gaps can be immediately closed
- **Focus on risk** - Prioritize review of high-severity items
- **Check evidence** - Verify claimed progress with artifacts
- **Consider context** - Understand organizational constraints
