# Reviewing Evidence

Best practices for evaluating assessment evidence.

## Evidence Types

Organizations provide various forms of evidence:

### Documents

- Policies and procedures
- Training materials
- Audit reports
- Certifications

### Screenshots

- System configurations
- Security settings
- Access control implementations
- Monitoring dashboards

### Logs and Reports

- Audit logs
- Vulnerability scans
- Penetration test reports
- Compliance reports

### Records

- Training records
- Access review documentation
- Incident response records
- Change management tickets

## Accessing Evidence

Evidence is linked to controls and accessible from:

- **Control Review** - Evidence tab shows linked artifacts
- **Evidence Library** - All evidence in one place
- **Package Overview** - Summary of evidence status

## Evidence Evaluation Criteria

When reviewing evidence, assess:

### Relevance

- Does the evidence directly support the control?
- Is it specific to the systems in scope?
- Does it address the actual requirement?

### Currency

- Is the evidence current (typically within 12 months)?
- Are dated documents still valid?
- Do screenshots reflect current configurations?

### Completeness

- Does evidence cover all aspects of the control?
- Are there gaps in coverage?
- Is supporting context provided?

### Authenticity

- Does the evidence appear genuine?
- Are screenshots unmodified?
- Can the evidence be verified?

## Evidence Review Workflow

### 1. Access the Evidence

Click on evidence items to view in the secure viewer.

### 2. Review Content

Examine the evidence against control requirements.

### 3. Make Determination

Assess if evidence adequately supports implementation.

### 4. Document Findings

Record observations in your control assessment.

## Evidence Sufficiency Guidelines

| Control Type | Expected Evidence |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Policy-based | Approved policy document, distribution records |
| Technical | Screenshots, configuration exports, scan results |
| Process-based | Procedures, execution records, audit trails |
| Training | Completion records, materials, sign-off sheets |

## Requesting Additional Evidence

If evidence is insufficient:

1. Click **Request Evidence** on the control
2. Specify what evidence is needed
3. Explain why current evidence is inadequate
4. Set a response deadline

## Evidence Red Flags

Watch for potential issues:

- **Dated evidence** - Artifacts more than 12 months old
- **Generic screenshots** - Stock images or templates
- **Mismatched dates** - Timestamps that don't align
- **Incomplete coverage** - Evidence missing key systems
- **Unverifiable claims** - Statements without supporting artifacts

## Secure Handling

Evidence often contains sensitive information:

- Review in secure environment
- Don't download unnecessarily
- Don't share outside assessment team
- Follow your organization's evidence handling procedures

## Best Practices

- **Review systematically** - Follow a consistent process for each evidence type
- **Cross-reference** - Compare evidence across related controls
- **Document thoroughly** - Note key observations for each piece
- **Ask questions** - Request clarification when needed
