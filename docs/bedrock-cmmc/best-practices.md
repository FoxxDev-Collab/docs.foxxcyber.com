## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

| Pitfall | Better Approach |
|---------|-----------------|
| Waiting until the last minute | Start preparation 6-12 months ahead |
| Generic policies not tailored to your org | Customize policies to reflect actual practices |
| Evidence without context | Include descriptions explaining relevance |
| Orphaned POA&Ms | Regularly review and update remediation status |
| Single point of failure for knowledge | Cross-train team members on compliance |
| Treating CMMC as a one-time event | Build continuous compliance into operations |
