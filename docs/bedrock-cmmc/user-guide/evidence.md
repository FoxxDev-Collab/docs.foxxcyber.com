## Evidence Best Practices

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Use descriptive file names | Upload files with generic names like "doc1.pdf" |
| Link evidence to specific requirements | Leave evidence unlinked |
| Set expiration dates for time-sensitive docs | Let certifications expire without notice |
| Include version numbers in file names | Upload duplicate versions |

## Linking Evidence to Requirements

When uploading or editing evidence:

1. Select the requirements this evidence supports
2. The linked requirements count appears on the evidence list
3. Assessors can easily verify evidence during review
