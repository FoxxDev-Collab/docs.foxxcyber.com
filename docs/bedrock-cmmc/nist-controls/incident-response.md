## 03.06.01 - Incident Handling

**Requirement:** Establish an operational incident handling capability for organizational systems that includes preparation, detection, analysis, containment, recovery, and user response activities.

:::info Discussion
Organizations recognize that incident handling capabilities are dependent on the capabilities of organizational systems and the mission/business processes being supported by those systems. Organizations consider incident handling as part of the definition, design, and development of mission/business processes and systems.

## 03.06.02 - Incident Reporting

**Requirement:** Track, document, and report incidents to designated officials and/or authorities both internal and external to the organization.

:::info Discussion
Tracking and documenting system security incidents includes maintaining records about each incident, the status of the incident, and other pertinent information necessary for forensics, evaluating incident details, trends, and handling. Incident information can be obtained from a variety of sources.
:::

## 03.06.03 - Incident Response Testing

**Requirement:** Test the organizational incident response capability.

:::info Discussion
Organizations test incident response capabilities to determine the effectiveness of the capabilities and to identify potential weaknesses or deficiencies. Incident response testing includes the use of checklists, walk-through or tabletop exercises, simulations (both parallel and full interrupt), and comprehensive exercises.
:::

---

## 03.06.04 - Incident Response Plan

**Requirement:** Develop and implement an incident response plan.

:::info Discussion
Incident response plans include a roadmap for implementing the incident response capability.
:::

---

## 03.06.05 - Incident Response Assistance

**Requirement:** Provide incident response assistance resources that offer advice and assistance to users.

:::info Discussion
Incident response assistance resources can include help desks, assistance groups, and access to forensics services when required.
:::

---

## 03.06.06 - Incident Monitoring

**Requirement:** Monitor and report on user-reported events in organizational systems.

:::info Discussion
User reporting channels include help desks and are a key element of incident response capabilities. The intent is to identify security incidents that go beyond normal notification of failed or denied authentications.
