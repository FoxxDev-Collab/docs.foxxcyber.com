## 03.08.01 - Media Access

**Requirement:** Protect (i.e., physically control and securely store) system media containing CUI, both paper and digital.

:::info Discussion
System media includes digital and non-digital media. Digital media includes diskettes, magnetic tapes, external or removable hard disk drives, flash drives, compact discs, and digital video discs. Non-digital media includes paper and microfilm.
:::

---

## 03.08.02 - Media Storage

**Requirement:** Limit access to CUI on system media to authorized users.

:::info Discussion
Access can be limited by physically controlling system media and secure storage areas. Physically controlling system media includes conducting inventories, ensuring procedures are in place to allow individuals to check out and return system media to the media library, and maintaining accountability for all stored media.
:::

---

## 03.08.03 - Media Marking

**Requirement:** Sanitize or destroy system media containing CUI before disposal or release for reuse.

:::info Discussion
This requirement applies to all system media, digital and non-digital, subject to disposal or reuse. Methods of sanitization include clearing, purging, cryptographic erase, and destruction. Organizations conduct sanitization or destruction of system media in accordance with federal and organizational standards and policies.
:::

---

## 03.08.04 - Media Accountability

**Requirement:** Mark media with necessary CUI markings and distribution limitations.

:::info Discussion
The term security marking refers to the application or use of human-readable security attributes. System media includes digital and non-digital media. Marking of system media reflects applicable federal and organizational policy.
:::

---

## 03.08.05 - Media Transport

**Requirement:** Control access to media containing CUI and maintain accountability for media during transport outside of controlled areas.

:::info Discussion
Controlled areas are areas or spaces for which organizations provide physical or procedural controls to meet the requirements established for protecting systems and information. Controls to maintain accountability for media during transport include locked containers and cryptography.
:::

---

## 03.08.06 - Cryptographic Protection

**Requirement:** Implement cryptographic mechanisms to protect the confidentiality of CUI stored on digital media during transport unless otherwise protected by alternative physical safeguards.

:::info Discussion
This requirement applies to portable storage devices (e.g., USB memory sticks, digital video disks, compact disks, external or removable hard disk drives). Cryptographic mechanisms can provide confidentiality and integrity protections.
:::

---

## 03.08.07 - Media Disposal

**Requirement:** Control the use of removable media on system components.

:::info Discussion
In contrast to requirement 03.08.03, which restricts user access to media, this requirement restricts the use of certain types of media on systems. Examples include restrictions on the use of portable storage devices or audio and compact disk based storage devices.
