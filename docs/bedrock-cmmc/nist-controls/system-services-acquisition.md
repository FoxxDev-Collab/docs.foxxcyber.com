## 03.12.01 - System Development Life Cycle

**Requirement:** Periodically review and update the security requirements for systems and system services.

:::info Discussion
Organizations review and update security requirements whenever systems and services are modified, including when new threats or vulnerabilities are identified. Security requirements reviews and updates ensure that the requirements are aligned with applicable federal and organizational policies, regulations, and other guidance.
:::

---

## 03.12.02 - Developer Configuration Management

**Requirement:** Require that developers and integrators create and implement a system development life cycle that addresses security requirements.

:::info Discussion
Trusted relationships between developers and integrators and the organization help facilitate security requirements. Requirements for documentation provide organizations with a traceable record of security measures and the processes followed during the development of systems.
:::

---

## 03.12.03 - Developer Security Testing

**Requirement:** Require that system developers and integrators, either internally or externally, create a security plan.

:::info Discussion
Security plans address the authorization requirements for systems that process, store, or transmit CUI and help to ensure that developers and integrators design and implement the system in accordance with organizational security requirements.
:::

---

## 03.12.04 - Acquisition Process

**Requirement:** Include security requirements, descriptions, and criteria, explicitly or by reference, in acquisition contracts.

:::info Discussion
Contracts can include organizational and federal security requirements, definitions and concepts, or other security-related contract language. Security requirements can be reflected in the substance of the contract or within the contract attachments.
:::

---

## 03.12.05 - External System Services

**Requirement:** Employ only organization-defined external system services in accordance with applicable federal and organizational security requirements.

:::info Discussion
External system services are services that are provided by an external provider. System service providers have a wide range of security standards and can provide varying levels of assurance. Organizations need to properly manage risk from the use of external services.
