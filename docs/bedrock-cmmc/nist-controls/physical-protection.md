## 03.10.01 - Physical Access Control

**Requirement:** Limit physical access to organizational systems, equipment, and the respective operating environments to authorized individuals.

:::info Discussion
Controlling physical access to organizational systems and equipment reduces the risk of unauthorized individuals accessing systems and equipment. Physical access controls include key cards, biometric readers, or locked doors. Organizations can use physical access control in combination with other types of controls such as identification and authentication to help ensure the appropriate level of security.

## 03.10.02 - Physical Access Authorization

**Requirement:** Protect and monitor the physical facility and support infrastructure for organizational systems.

:::info Discussion
Monitoring facilities includes reviews of physical access logs, as well as the use of alarm systems and video surveillance. Organizations protect the physical facility and support infrastructure such as heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning systems, electric power, water, and gas.
:::

## 03.10.03 - Escort Visitors

**Requirement:** Escort visitors and monitor visitor activity.

:::info Discussion
Visitor logs include names and organizations of persons visiting, dates of visits, times of entry and exit, purposes of visits, and organizational personnel members visited. Physical access controls to facilities where organizational systems reside are employed to ensure that visitors are escorted.
:::

---

## 03.10.04 - Physical Access Logs

**Requirement:** Maintain audit logs of physical access.

:::info Discussion
Organizations use physical access logs to identify anomalous physical access activities and implement measures to investigate such activities. Physical access logs include details such as the identity of individuals authorized to access controlled areas and the date and time of access.
:::

---

## 03.10.05 - Manage Physical Access

**Requirement:** Control and manage physical access devices.

:::info Discussion
Organizations use different forms of physical access controls depending on the characteristics of the facility and the individuals authorized to access the facility. Physical access controls include badge readers, turnstiles, and locks. Organizations replace or disable physical access devices when individuals are no longer authorized access or when devices are compromised.
:::

---

## 03.10.06 - Alternative Work Sites

**Requirement:** Enforce safeguards for CUI at alternate work sites.

:::info Discussion
Alternate work sites include government facilities or private residences of individuals. While typically distinct from alternative processing sites, alternate work sites may provide readily available alternate processing sites depending on organization requirements.
