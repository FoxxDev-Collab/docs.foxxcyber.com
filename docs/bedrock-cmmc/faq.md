# Frequently Asked Questions

Common questions about the Bedrock CMMC Platform and the certification process.

## Assessment Process

### How long does the assessment process take?

Typical assessments range from 4-8 weeks depending on organization size and complexity. Factors that affect timeline include:

- Number of systems in scope
- CMMC level being assessed
- Completeness of documentation
- Responsiveness to assessor requests

### Can I work with multiple C3PAOs?

You can request assessments from multiple C3PAOs, but typically work with one at a time per package. This avoids confusion and ensures consistent communication.

### What happens if I fail my assessment?

You'll receive detailed findings from your assessor. Next steps:

1. Review and understand each finding
2. Create POA&Ms to address gaps
3. Implement remediation measures
4. Request a reassessment when ready

There's no penalty for failing - you simply need to address the gaps and try again.

### How often do I need to recertify?

CMMC certifications are valid for 3 years, after which reassessment is required. However, you must maintain compliance continuously during this period.
